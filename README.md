# Route-Transposition-Cipher
A program which takes a string as input and encrypts it using a transposition cipher. The user types in the string they want to encrypt, the dimensions which will be used to create a vector matrix, and the direction of encryption (either clockwise or counter-clockwise). With the dimensions the user provides, a vector matrix is created and is then filled up with only letters from the string the user typed in. If the vector matrix is bigger than how many characters the user wants to encrypt, then the rest of it will be filled in with 'X'. Once the vector matrix is filled, the program will then encrypt either clockwise of counter-clockwise depending on what the user specified and will output the encrypted string to the console.
